# chord-regex
purpose:  
 - identify musical chords in text;
 - (future) utilities to transpose chords,   
 - shorten long representation
 - normalize them to a single standard

According to MY standards, of course: there are multiple ways to represent the same piece of music, and I choose the shorter, not necessarily the more "correct" way.

# Thus, for example 
 - `A7sus4` -> `A7,4`
 - `Dmin` -> `Dm`
 - `♯`, `♭` -> `#, `b`
 - `Fmin7♭5` -> `Fø`

etc.
